== Autograding process:

Two files:
 - Student submission
 - Grading file

The student submission should be one of:
 - A stand-alone file
 - A .tar.gz archive
 - A zip archive

If the student submission is an archive and contains
exactly one (non-hidden) directory, the stuff in that
directory is unnested for grading.

A grading file should be one of:
 - A single script with a valid schebang line.
 - A .tar.gz archive containing multiple scripts
   (in /grading) and possible supplemental data.

Grading operates as follows:
 - The container is started.
 - The submission and grading files are copied into
   /root in the container.
 - If the grading file is an archive, it's unpacked.
   - Otherwise, it's the "grading" script.
 - Grading occurs in four steps. In each step, a user-provided
   script is executed in the sandbox if available. Otherwise,
   a default script is executed.
 - The four stages are:
   - setup (run as root)
   - unpack
   - build
   - grade
 - The standard output of the 'grade' stage is expected to be the
   test results in some machine readable but human displayable
   format.
